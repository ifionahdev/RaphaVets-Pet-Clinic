This file is a temporary note of changes applied to Header.js and HomePage.js:

Header.js
- Imported useLocation
- Added handleNavClick(href) which:
  - resolves id from href
  - if already on '/', scrolls the element into view smoothly
  - otherwise navigates to '/' with state { scrollTo: id }
- Replaced desktop and mobile nav anchor elements with buttons using the handler

HomePage.js
- Imported useLocation and useNavigate
- Added useEffect that checks location.state.scrollTo and scrolls to the element after navigation then clears the state

If something needs tweaking (offset for fixed header), we can add an offset scroll calculation.
